### Creating CSS Releases

To do a release run `npm run release:css`. Keep in mind this process will create a release branch and build the release artifact on your local repo. **Save your progress before running this command**. After finishing your release simply `git stash` and move to the development branch (`git checkout develop`), deleting any remaining release files afterwards.
