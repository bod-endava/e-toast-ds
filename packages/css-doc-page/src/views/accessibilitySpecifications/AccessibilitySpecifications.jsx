          Gestalt Principles

        <p>When Designing Consider Gestalt principles:</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Gestalt laws say that the mind understands the whole is greater than the sum of
          its parts. In other words, the mind will always try to simplify a group of
          things. For example: when you see a house, you will see the whole and quickly
          define it as "a house" not as "a roof with a structure and a door. Your mind
          will identify the whole first and then will appreciate the details.

            <p>
              the human eye follows lines, curves, or a sequence of shapes in order
              to determine a relationship between design elements. This means that
              all the design elements place as a list horizontal or vertical will be
              identified as part of the same group.

          Font
        </h3>
        <p>
          Choose a common font that most users have encountered before. Research shows
          that readers read faster and are happier with familiar typefaces than with
          unfamiliar ones. Sans-Serif or Serif are safe choices. Choose a typeface that
          works well in various sizes.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Size
        </h3>
        <p>
          Use 16 pixel for body text or as the base to create the Type scale. Ensure that
          default fonts are no smaller than 9 pt (12px). Smaller sizes may be illegible
          on some platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember to provide relative font size such as percentages or units of em apart
          from absolutes such as pixels or points. This will allows the text to easily
          rezise across multiple devices and platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          WCAG recommendation is to ensure that text can be zoomed to 200%. As well, we
          recommend using liquid layouts that can accommodate 200% text.

        <h3>
          Optimize Typography

          <br/>
          Line spacing: at least 1.5x the font size
          <br/>
          Paragraph spacing: at least 1.5x the line spacing
          <br/>

          Text Hierarchy

          (size, weight, face, or color) This ensures they create contrast between them but are 
          related to each other with some consistency, which helps with scanning.
